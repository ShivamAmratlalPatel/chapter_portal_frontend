        <h2>How to be a "Hindu" PR Rep</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>As a HINDU society PR rep it is important that you carry our Hindu values (or sanskaars) through all that you do.</li>
            <li>You don’t have to be an expert - just be willing to explore and learn concepts, utsavs (celebrations) and other content so you’re able to better convey this to your members</li>
            <li>Remember that even though it may be “banter” to leave funny comments on your friends pages, it may come across poorly aligning with the values you as a society are showcasing.</li>
            <li>Take the family online - leave positive comments on the posts of alum, members and friends of the society. Words of encouragement could make someone’s day.</li>
            <li>Share what you know - you have a unique opportunity to share any interesting discussions you may have had a society or resources that you may have made - share so they can be used and learnt from much wider!</li>
