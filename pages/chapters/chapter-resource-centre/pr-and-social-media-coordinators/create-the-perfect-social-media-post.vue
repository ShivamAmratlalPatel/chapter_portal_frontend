    <h1>Creating the Perfect Social Media Post</h1>
    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use shorter captions</li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to condense the captions so that your followers are more likely to read through the entire caption</li>
                <li>Keep key information at the top - dates, times, places, the theme</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            Use of emojis
            <ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Appropriate emojis should be used dependent on the feel of each post, such as hype, excitement or humour.</li>
                    <li>However, it is very easy to overdo it, which will lead to followers not reading through each post.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Use of vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to audience
            <ul>
                <li>Followers may not know the inside jokes or knowledge within the society</li>
                <li>Post as if your audience is new to your society</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Remember your audience
            <ul>
                <li>Students will likely make up the majority of your audience</li>
                <li>Make things relevant for them - current events, trends, etc.</li>
                <li>Remember your social media pages may also be followed by parents, businesses, etc.</li>
                <li>These can be prospective sponsors or relations - so be mindful of how your social media portrays your society.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Scheduling Posts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use your stats in your favour</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Review your pageâ€™s statistics from previous posts - this will give you an idea of when the best time to post is for highest engagement and interaction.</li>
            <li>We recommend 6pm - 9pm on weekdays, and 10pm - 12am on weekends.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Schedule your posts - Facebook allows you to do this, as well as Twitter through TweetDeck</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This means posts can be created and written ahead of time.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
