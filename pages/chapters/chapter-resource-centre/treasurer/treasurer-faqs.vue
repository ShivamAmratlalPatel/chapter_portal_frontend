            <AccordionTab header="What should we do if our initial balance is lower than £100 or even £0?">
                <Fieldset legend="Cost-Free">
                    <p>Having little or no money doesn’t mean that you can’t run a Hindu society. Discussion events, debates and workshops about our dharma are a great way to bring everyone together without spending money!</p>
                </Fieldset>
                <Fieldset legend="Raising Money">
                    <p>Alongside this, you can start raising funds throughout the year through membership fees, selling Zonal Navratri tickets, society merchandise, samosa sales and more!</p>
                </Fieldset>
            </AccordionTab>
            <AccordionTab header="What if I inherit the previous committee’s debt?">
                <ul>
                    <li>Previous committees should ensure that they clear all debts before leaving.</li>
                    <li>It is not your responsibility to deal with existing debt, and you should start on a clean slate.</li>
                </ul>
            </AccordionTab>
            <AccordionTab header="What if we make a loss on an event?">
                <ul>
                    <li>Making a loss on an event is not the end of the world and happens on occasions, but you should at least try to break even for every event.</li>
                    <li>If you do make a loss, try and ensure you make a profit on subsequent events to break even over the whole semester.</li>
                </ul>
            </AccordionTab>
            <AccordionTab header="What if a committee member unexpectedly asks for a reimbursement?">
                <p>This is your decision. You shouldn’t automatically say no to refunds, but discuss with them to ensure that the purchase is valid and proof is given in an agreed time-scale.</p>
            </AccordionTab>
            <AccordionTab header="What if a committee member loses a receipt?">
                <Fieldset legend="No Receipt, No Refund">
                    <p>Try to implement a rule of ‘no receipt, no refunds’ to ensure that no major issues arise throughout the year, and encourage committee members to take care of receipts.</p>
                </Fieldset>
                <Fieldset legend="Flexibility">
                    <p>If the amount involved is high, and you trust the committee member, see if the students’ union will accept a different receipt.</p>
                </Fieldset>
            </AccordionTab>
            <AccordionTab header="What if we don’t have enough balance to pay the first deposit for a venue?">
                <ul>
                    <li>Explain your financial situation to the venue or company and see if you can pay later or offer part of the payment now.</li>
                    <li>For flagship events, consider asking committee members to pay for their tickets first to ensure you have some available funds.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Clarify the donor’s expectations and ensure both of you understand the difference between sponsorship and donation.</li>
                    <li>If they still want something, inform them that you are ready to sign a contract or written agreement. Maintain professionalism to avoid repetitive requests.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Try to negotiate with them or ask for them to refund your deposit, explaining that you are representing a student society.</li>

                </ol>
            </AccordionTab>
            <AccordionTab header="What if we feel we do not have enough funds to put on an event?">
