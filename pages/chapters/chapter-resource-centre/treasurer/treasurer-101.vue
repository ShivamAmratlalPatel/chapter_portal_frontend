1. A role with significant responsibility: you have your society’s future in your hands.
2. Every decision should be in the best interests of the society and its members.
3. Being a Treasurer is about finding balance: you must be firm and prudent but also do what is right and fair for everyone.


Key Responsibilities
 Prepare a budget for the forthcoming year.
Ensure there is enough money for the year and future years.
Look for potential sponsorship and grant opportunities.
Maintain accurate records of all income and expenditure.
Authorise any expenditure made by other committee members.
Ensure all invoices are paid on time.

Budgeting
Understand
Cash Flows
It is essential to understand all of your societies ‘INs’ and ‘OUTs’ so you know what exactly you can afford, allowing you to make an accurate budget for the event.


Don’t Be Afraid to Say NO!
The Treasurer can have more decision-making power than the President. If you think that the society cannot afford something, you shouldn’t be afraid of rejecting the proposal.


Over- and
Under-estimate
When budgeting, overestimate your expenditure and underestimate your income to avoid disappointment and ensure financial stability.


Efficient
Communication
Maintain a good relationship with your committee members that organise events, and ask about each event in advance so you can create a budget and a profit/loss forecast.


Consistency
Each event should have its own budget. Try to use the same template for every event.



Accounts Control
Profit and Loss Statements
Create a profit-and-loss statement for every event and a cumulative statement for each semester to keep track of finances.


Keeping
Accurate
Records
Keep records of all deposits and withdrawals, using separate balance sheets for personal and students’ union accounts where required.
For students’ union accounts, regularly request the balance and statement, and check that all transactions are recorded properly.


Limited Access
Limit accounts access to the President and Treasurer to ensure confidentiality and in order to maintain the cash flow.


Weekly
Updates
Present weekly finance updates to your President and one or two other committee members.
This helps you to remain organised, get backing for budgeting and allows someone else to pick up your work whilst you are unavailable.


Keep Receipts
Keep a copy of all invoices and receipts in a file for future reference.


Raising Income

Funding and
Grants
Use additional funding and semester grants from your students’ union where possible to preserve your own balance.


Sponsorship ≠ Donation
A donation is money given without expecting anything in exchange.
A sponsor will expect something in exchange, such as advertising.
Look out for the different situations you may face and ensure you remain professional when working with potential sponsors.
